## About the Collection

This digital exhibit highlights the work of two Anthropology Senior Seminar classes. In 2024, the theme of the class was "The Anthropology of You," and in 2025 the theme was "The Anthropology of the Beyond Human." We hope the interplay of both themes leads you to think about your relationship to yourself and the world around you.
